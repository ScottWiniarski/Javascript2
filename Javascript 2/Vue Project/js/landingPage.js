            Unfortunately, due to the recent increase in hostilities with local wildlife, management
            has determined that all employees must have a B.A.C percentage of less than .05 before deployment 
            to a work-zone. Management appreciates your compliance, and reminds you that failure to meet this 
            standard comes with penalties to your employee record.
